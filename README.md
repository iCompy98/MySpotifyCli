# MySpotifyCli

This project will be a Spotifi Cli, with the functionalities that Spotify Api 
gives us. It's a personal idea in my intention to work in terminal, minimizing 
the graphic tools use.

## Requirements

- A Spotify account, doesn't matter if premium or free. But, obviously, the free 
account will be more restricted in some functions.

- A Spotify App created: you can create it in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/.
At the end, you need to have the clientId, the secretId and set a Redirect Uri, in
the settings. The Redirect Uri must be like `localhost:8888/callback`, the X's
represents a port, make sure to use an unoccupied port.

- Docker, i have the 20.10.10 version, but i think that is innecesary

## Instalation
